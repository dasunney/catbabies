      Kong is a 3 years old shorthair black cat. We adopted Kong the year my family moved to New York. My father has found an advertisement
      on his phone about a family adopting out 2-3 months old baby kittens. Our days have changed ever since Kong joined our family. He was
      a curious kitty from the get go. He was not afraid, only adventurous. Ironically, Kong is a 100% indoor cat. The only time he goes outside
      is for vet visits or when he needs to be cat-sitted due to an extended trip. We did open the door before and he would look around as close as
      needed and come back. Our queen is a thicc boi. He is naturally a bigger sized cat, and he rocks it. Kong loves toys that involve allow him to
      chase something and run around. We tend to play with a laser pointer or a fishing pole with a feather on the end. This is especially great as 
      he is a very friendly cat and will introduce himself to any human he sees. He will play with anyone, but obviously will prefer his family as he
      is used and most familiar with us.

      Peach is probably a 2 years old orange tabby. He is a year younger than Kong as we adopted him as a kitten a year after we adopted Kong. We noticed 
      that all of us were mostly out of the house due to our jobs or school; this meant that Kong was alone most of the day. This made us want another
      cat for Kong to be close with. Peach was a little different from Kong. He was actually a street kitty for 2-3 months before someone took him in and 
      fostered him. My dad has been closely following kitten foster homes or adoption advertisement and this is how we found Peach. Peach is what the textbook
      definition of a scarey cat. He is afraid and extremely cautious of everything. Peach will run away at the first signs of danger, even if there isn't any. 
      He only trusts a certain few, which would be me and my sister. The others he tend to be more cautious. He always hides from strangers. Ironically, he is also
      an attention seeker. He wants attention. If you were doing anything before Peach came, well now you have to give your full attention to him. 
      Pet him with both hands or else he will keep bumping his head onto the free hand.
